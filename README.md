# Brain Tumors Detection

In this project a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) built to detect brain tumors from MRI images.

There are two pre-trained models in this repo :
1. Binary Cross entropy :  `BrainTumor10Epochs.h5` Â  
2. Categorical Cross Entropy : `BrainTumorCategorical10Epochs.h5`
